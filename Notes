1. Install Git-python library using Pycharm.

2. Initialize the local repo and give file path but replace "\" with "/".

3. Index the file to be commited.
    INDEXING: 
      It means adding the file to the staging area between local and Git repository.
      
4. Now create a new text file in local repo using python.
    CREATING A NEW FILE:  
      Follow the link: {https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-create-text-file/}

5.  NOTE:   To push or pull from a remote git repo, first you have to set the origin. This is done by cloning. 
            Cloning git repo in local repo automatically set the origin for push / pull.

6. NOTE - BRANCHES: To get the ref for an existing branch:
                                            {{ "repo.get_git_ref( "heads/branchnamehere")" }}
                    To create a new branch:
                                            {{ "" }}
                    
      
-- -- WORKING WITH BRANCHES:
             {{ # List all branches
                list(repo.get_branches())

                # Create a new branch
                repo.get.branch('my_new_branch')

                # To checkout to a branch:
                repo.get.checkout('branch_name')  
                
                # Get protection status of a branch:
                branch.protected
            }}
            
-- -- MERGING BRANCHES:
        To Merge the current branch to the master (or any specified) branch:
           {{  import  git 

                repo = git.Repo('.')
                master = repo.branches['master']
                current = repo.branches['feature']
                root = repo.merge_base(current, master)
                repo.index.merge_tree(master, base=root)
                repo.index.commit('merging master into current branch', parent_commits=(current.commit, master.commit))
            }}
